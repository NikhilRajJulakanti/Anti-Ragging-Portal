# Anti-Ragging-Portal

The Anti-Ragging Portal is an initiative designed to provide a secure, accessible platform for students to report instances of ragging, ensuring confidentiality and prompt acknowledgment of their complaints. Through this portal, students can easily submit complaints, receive real-time notifications via email upon successful submission, and access detailed information on anti-ragging laws, creating a supportive ecosystem to discourage and mitigate ragging practices. The platform also features a contact section, offering direct communication channels for students seeking further assistance. Developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP, the portal integrates PHPMailer to handle automated email notifications, with all user data securely stored in a database. This project addresses the urgent need for effective anti-ragging mechanisms in educational institutions, aiming to foster a safer and more inclusive campus environment.
